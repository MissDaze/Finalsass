    <h1>Website Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the Sassy Vintage Tees website and the purchase of our products. By accessing this site or placing an order, you agree to these Terms. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law. [web:15][web:18][web:53]
    </p>

    <h2>1. About us</h2>
    <p>
      Sassy Vintage Tees (“we”, “us”, “our”) sells printed apparel online to customers in Australia. Our contact email is yourname@example.com.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of this website</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use this website for lawful purposes only and not to engage in any activity that may damage or overload the site or interfere with other users.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Pre‑order sales</h2>
    <p>
      Our current drop is sold on a pre‑order basis. When you place a pre‑order, you are purchasing a product that is not yet printed or ready for immediate shipment. Approximate print and delivery timeframes are set out on the product page and in our Pre‑order Info page.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we do our best to meet these timeframes, they are estimates only. If there is a significant delay, we will contact you with an updated estimate and options, which may include a refund.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Orders and payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All prices on the site are in Australian Dollars (AUD) and include GST where applicable.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to change prices at any time, but changes will not affect orders that have already been placed.</li>
      <li>Payment is processed securely through Stripe and your order is confirmed once payment has been successfully authorised. [web:10][web:12]</li>
      <li>We may cancel or refuse an order if we suspect fraud, unauthorised activity or significant error in pricing or description.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Shipping</h2>
    <p>
      Shipping costs and options are displayed at checkout. Pre‑orders are expected to dispatch in the second week of March 2026, but this is an estimate only and may change due to printing or courier delays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk in the goods passes to you when the order is delivered to the address provided. Please ensure your delivery details are correct, as we are not responsible for items delivered to an incorrect address provided by you.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Returns, refunds and Australian Consumer Law</h2>
    <p>
      Our Returns and Refunds Policy forms part of these Terms and is available on the Refunds page. In addition to our policy, you have rights to a repair, replacement or refund under the Australian Consumer Law for products that are faulty, not as described or fail to meet consumer guarantees. [web:15][web:18][web:35]
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not offer refunds if you simply change your mind or select the wrong size, but we’ll always aim to help where we reasonably can.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Product colours and sizing</h2>
    <p>
      We do our best to display product colours and artwork accurately, but actual colours may vary slightly between screens and print runs. Size charts are provided as a guide only.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      All artwork, designs, logos, text and images on this website are owned by us or used with permission. You must not copy, reproduce or use any content without our written consent, except for personal, non‑commercial use.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties and conditions not expressly stated in these Terms. Where we cannot exclude liability under the Australian Consumer Law, our liability is limited, where permitted, to the replacement or repair of the goods or the cost of doing so.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Links to other sites</h2>
    <p>
      Any links to third‑party websites are provided for convenience only. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the content of those sites.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia, and any disputes will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria.
