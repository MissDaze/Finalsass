    <h1>Returns & Refunds Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      We want you to love your new tee. This policy explains how we handle returns, exchanges and refunds for purchases made through our website. It should be read together with our Terms & Conditions. Nothing in this policy limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law. [web:15][web:18][web:35]
    </p>

    <h2>1. Change of mind and sizing issues</h2>
    <p>
      Because this drop is printed to order based on pre‑orders, we generally cannot offer refunds for change of mind, or if you ordered the wrong size or colour. Please check the size guide carefully before placing your order.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you make a mistake with your order details, contact us as soon as possible at yourname@example.com. If we have not yet sent the order to print, we may be able to update your details.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Faulty, damaged or incorrect items</h2>
    <p>
      If your item arrives faulty, damaged or not as described, please email us within a reasonable time with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your order number</li>
      <li>A description of the issue</li>
      <li>Clear photos of the item and the issue</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once we confirm the problem, we will work with you to provide an appropriate remedy under the Australian Consumer Law, which may include a replacement, repair or refund, depending on the circumstances. [web:35]
    </p>

    <h2>3. Pre‑order delays</h2>
    <p>
      The expected timeline for this pre‑order is printing at the end of February 2026 and dispatch in the second week of March 2026. If there is a significant delay beyond this window, we will contact you with an updated estimate and you may choose to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your order and wait for the new delivery date; or</li>
      <li>Request a refund if the new timeframe does not work for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How to request a return or refund</h2>
    <p>Please email us at yourname@example.com with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name and order number</li>
      <li>Details of the issue</li>
      <li>Photos, if applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We’ll respond as soon as we can with next steps. Please do not send items back until we have confirmed the return address and process.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Shipping costs</h2>
    <p>
      If we determine that the item is faulty, damaged or not as described, we will cover reasonable return shipping costs or provide a prepaid label where possible. For change‑of‑mind returns agreed at our discretion, you will be responsible for return postage.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      For any questions about this policy, contact us at yourname@example.com.
